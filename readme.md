# Titlor
The package is in packages/ directory. It is included into the project to show that it works. On the project index page,
there is a link to Titlor pannel where you can add and edit titles for existing routes.
There is a migration in packages/Chursina/Titlor/database/migration and a copy in database/migrations (copied by
'php artisan vendor:publish && php artisan migrate'), but I also attach a DB dump.
